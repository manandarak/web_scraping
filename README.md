Setting up and Running the Scraping Application
Dependencies
Python 3.x
requests library: For making HTTP requests.
bs4 (Beautiful Soup): For parsing HTML content.
mysql-connector-python: For connecting to MySQL database.
Installation
Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from Python's official website.
Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip. Open your command line interface and run the following commands:
Copy code
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install mysql-connector-python
Running the Application
Clone Repository: Clone the repository containing your scraping application code from your version control system (e.g., GitHub) or download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory on your local machine.

Database Setup:

Ensure you have a MySQL database set up where you want to store the scraped data.
Note down the database credentials (username, password, host, database name) for connecting to the MySQL database.
Configure Application:

Open the Python script containing the scraping code in a text editor.
Replace placeholders 'your_username', 'your_password', 'localhost', and 'your_database' in the code with your actual MySQL database details.
Run the Application:

Open a command line interface and navigate to the directory containing the Python script (scraping_script.py).
Run the script by executing the following command:
Copy code
python scraping_script.py
Monitoring:

During execution, the application will log any errors encountered during scraping to a file named scraping.log in the same directory.
If the task is completed successfully, the application will print "Task completed successfully!" to the console.
Additional Notes
Ensure you have an active internet connection while running the application as it scrapes data from online sources.
Monitor the log file (scraping.log) for any errors or issues encountered during scraping. If errors occur, review the log file to troubleshoot and rectify them.
By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the scraping application successfully to fetch data from the specified URLs and store it in your MySQL database
